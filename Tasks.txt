Arguments of the function: the number X

For example, X = 5.
Output of the program:
1
2
3
4
5
Exercise 2

Write the function drawRectangle which draws a rectangle from the symbols '+'
Function arguments: the width of the rectangle in the symbols, the height of the rectangle in the symbols

For example 3 by 2
Output of the program:
+ + +
+ + +

Exercise 3

For example 2
Output of the program:
+ +
+ +

For example 3
Output of the program:
